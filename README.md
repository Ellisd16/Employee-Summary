# Employee-Summary


### About

I was tasked with creating an application that would allow for managers to add employees to an HTML page using Node.js. The key to this project was using "Classes" and the "Inquirer" package.

### Development

Using Classes, I developed a framework for the user data to be pushed into. After that, I used Inquirer to prompt a questionare that forked into different questions (depending on which role you picked.) Finally, once the app got the user's information, it pushed all the data into an HTML page call "team.html"

### Problems

For some reason, my code won't run the questionare again after the last prompt (add more employees). If you happen to know the reason behind this. Feel free to email me: ellisdelgado13@gmail.com. Thanks!
